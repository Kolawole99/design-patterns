/**
 *
 * State pattern is used to represent the state of the object in the context of the state machine pattern.
 * State is a behavioral design pattern that lets an object alter its behavior when its internal state changes.
 *
 * It appears as if the object changed its class.
 * The State pattern is closely related to the concept of a Finite-State Machine.
 *
 * The main idea is that, at any given moment, there’s a finite number of states which a program can be in.
 * Within any unique state, the program behaves differently, and the program can be switched from one state to another instantaneously.
 * However, depending on a current state, the program may or may not switch to certain other states.
 * These switching rules, called transitions, are also finite and predetermined.
